# Onboarding

Below are the steps that a new user follows to sign up and start using TAMTRADES.

1. **Visit the Application**  
   - Navigate to the main URL of the TAMTRADES app.  
   - The user sees a welcome interface or landing page.

2. **Sign Up / Create Account**  
   - Click on a "Sign Up" or "Get Started" button (it has the "cursor-pointer" class).  
   - Fill out the registration form if available. (Currently, we do not have a live authentication flow integrated, so this is a placeholder step for future development.)
   - Once completed, the user is redirected to the Dashboard or a dedicated onboarding screen.

3. **Optional Subscription Setup**  
   - If subscription or payment is required in future versions, the user will be prompted to select a plan and provide payment info.  
   - After successful payment (not yet implemented), they are granted access to premium features.

4. **Completion**  
   - The user lands in the main area of the app, ready to start journaling trades and exploring features.
